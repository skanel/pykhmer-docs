This document is used for training pykhmer team to prepare experienced engineers to be productive python programmers. 
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively. 
Thus, these lectures assumed the audience knew the concepts and showed how to use them in Python.
 We found this an effective way of getting new engineers up to speed quickly. 
 This is the written material that accompanied those lectures. 
 We have found that these are useful in their own right.
